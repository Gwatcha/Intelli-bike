* IntelliBike
The IntelliBike incorporates three main functionalities: a security system to prevent the bike from
being stolen, a safety system to keep the rider safe on the road, and a data logging system to
keep track of all the rides and rider statistics. By combining all of these systems into a single
project, the IntelliBike aims to provide users with an enjoyable and safe alternative to driving
and public transit.

The logging system makes use of an Android App which, on ride finish, uploads
data to a web server. A map of a users ride may then be found online, as well as ride statistics.

** Bike 
The IntelliBike was powered by a master Raspberry Pi which controlled various
peripherals including a slave Arduino. The Arduino powered an OLED screen which
displayed instantaneous acceleration, velocity, temperature, altitude, and a
very pretty boot up animation.

The Bike safety system would:
1. turn on lights when the ambient light sensor was below a threshold
2. notify the mobile phone in case of quick acceleration
3. automatically turning on brake lights on brake handle press,
4. turn on turn signals 

The security system would allow a user to lock the bike, hence the Keypad and
LCD screen. If a robber were to try to get away with the locked bike, the
security system would set off a very loud alarm.

** Android Mobile App
The mobile app serves to display a map for the user, as well as upload logged sensor data to
the web server on ride finish.

** Web server
The web server maintains a MySql database of IntelliBike users, and displays all
the 'routes' they have tracked online. It also supplies rider statistics for users.
