* IntelliBike
The IntelliBike incorporates three main functionalities: a security system to prevent the bike from
being stolen, a safety system to keep the rider safe on the road, and a data logging system to
keep track of all the rides and rider statistics. By combining all of these systems into a single
project, the IntelliBike aims to provide users with an enjoyable and safe alternative to driving
and public transit.

The logging system makes use of an Android App which, on ride finish, uploads
data to a web server. A map of a users ride may then be found online, as well as ride statistics.

** Android Mobile App
The mobile app serves to display a map for the user, as well as upload logged sensor data to
the web server on ride finish.

** Web server
The web server maintains a MySql database of IntelliBike users, and displays all
the 'routes' they have tracked. It also supplies rider statistics for users.

** Hardware 
The IntelliBike was powered by a master Raspberry Pi which controlled various
peripherals including a slave Arduino. The Arduino powered an OLED screen which
displayed instantaneous acceleration, velocity, temperature, altitude, and a
very pretty boot up animation.
